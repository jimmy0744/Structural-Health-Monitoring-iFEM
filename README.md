# iFEM Digital Twin Structural Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project develops a structural health monitoring framework using the inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) integrated with FEM simulation to create a Digital Twin for deformation analysis.

The system combines experimental strain measurements, numerical simulation, and automated visualization to validate structural behavior under static loading conditions.

## Key Features
- Structural deformation analysis using iFEM
- FEM validation with COMSOL
- Experimental strain and displacement measurements
- Automated simulation result visualization
- Digital Twin–driven monitoring workflow

## Tools & Technologies
- COMSOL Multiphysics
- MATLAB
- SolidWorks
- Python
- Strain Gauges
- Data Processing

## Engineering Workflow
Experiment → Strain Measurement → iFEM Calculation → FEM Simulation → Visualization

## Results
The validation results demonstrate high agreement between simulation and experimental data, confirming the accuracy of the proposed monitoring approach.
